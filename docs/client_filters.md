# Client Filters

Client filtering allows you to set a parameter for each question stored in QnABot. The answer to a question with a specific client filter will only be returned if the associated client filter value is sent in with the query. This will allow you to store the same question multiple times in the same QnABot instance and control which answer is returned based on the client filter parameter you send in.
