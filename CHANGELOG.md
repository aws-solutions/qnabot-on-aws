### Added

-   Intent and Slot matching (an early implementation). This new capability supports creating dedicated custom Intents for a QnABot {Item ID}. You can extend QnABot to support one or more related intents. For example, you might create an intent that makes a car reservation, or assists an agent during a live chat or call (via Amazon Connect). More details in README: https://github.com/aws-solutions/qnabot-on-aws/blob/v5.2.0/docs/intent_slot_matching/README.md
-   Support for using custom domain names for QnABot Designer and Client interfaces. More details in README: https://github.com/aws-solutions/qnabot-on-aws/blob/v5.2.0/docs/custom_domain_name_setup/README.md
-   AWS QnABot Command Line Interface (CLI) - the AWS QnABot CLI supports the capability to import and export questions and answers via command line. More details in README: https://github.com/aws-solutions/qnabot-on-aws/blob/v5.2.0/docs/qnabot_cli.md
-   Kendra Redirect - with the Kendra Redirect feature, you can now include a Kendra query within a Item ID. More details in README: https://github.com/aws-solutions/qnabot-on-aws/blob/v5.2.0/docs/kendra_redirect/README.md
-   Integration with Canvas LMS (an early example implementation). Students use their schools' learning management system (LMS) to keep track of their assignments, grades, and their course work. With this integration, students will be able to ask QnABot about their grades, syllabus, enrollments, assignments, and announcements.
    More details in README: https://github.com/aws-solutions/qnabot-on-aws/blob/v5.2.0/docs/canvaslms_integration.md

-   Updated runtime of Lambda functions (using Python runtime) to use Python runtime version 3.9.

### Changed

-   Solution GitHub repository's name was changed to QnABot on AWS.

### Fixed

-   Client Type was not detected when using LexWebUI with LexV2.
-   Implemented small score boost for items with no topic when topic is not set in the query. This breaks the ties, and allows a predictable response for an ambiguous question when there is no topic, by preferring an answer that also has no topic.
-   `Test All` functionality when `ENFORCE_VERIFIED_IDENTITY` is `true`.
-   Queries containing only {stop words} should return no_hits instead of random answer.
-   Metric logging issue when field count exceeds index limit.
-   Kendra support for multilanguage content search match.
-   QnABot Client not displaying updated language(s).
-   Updated es-warmer function to use qnabot common lib to pick up package for qnabot/logging. Without this, es-warmer immediately fails and does not complete keeping elasticsearch cache loaded with questions.
-   Addressed several issues related to presentation of Amazon Alexa skill cards.
-   Changed QnABot templates to use native Lex V2 Cloudformation template syntax for response bots.
-   Handling response card images with long URLs.

    for js-xlsx and read-excel-file.

## [5.1.1] - 2022-02-04

### Added

-   Expanded language support for voice and text interactions. Also included support for Neural voices for Lex language locales. See [supported languages](docs/multilanguage_support/README.md#supported-languages).

-   Updated `LexV2BotLocaleIds` parameter in CloudFormation template to include link to supported languages.
-   Updated [Multi Language Support readme](docs/multilanguage_support/README.md#supported-languages) and added supported languages section.
-   Updated `ENABLE_MULTI_LANGUAGE_SUPPORT` setting in [Settings readme](docs/settings.md) with link to supported languages.

### Fixed

-   Fixed Kendra Webcrawler data source sync issue by adding support to check for Kendra webcrawler data source {status} before initiating sync
-   Fixed issue where the Kendra Webcrawler data source {settings} page in Kendra console was resulting in a blank page - by updating configuration parameters for data source create and update steps

## [5.1.0] - 2021-12-09

### Added

-   Tags to questions in Content Designer and ability to create reports in Kibana.
-   Integration with Genesys call center platform.
-   Client Filtering with Session Attributes (i.e., Support to allow the same set of questions to be answered differently based on a session attribute).
-   Intelligent redaction of Personally Identifiable Information in logs with Amazon Comprehend.
-   A QnABot client (e.g. a Connect contact flow) can now optionally provide a value for session attribute, `qnabotUserId`. When this session attribute is set, QnABot tracks user activity based on the provided value. If not set, QnABot continues to track user activity based on the request userId (LexV1) or sessionId (LexV2). NOTE: `qnabotUserId` value is not used when user authentication using JWTs is enabled - in this case users are securely identified and verified from the JWT.
-   Support for pre and post processing AWS Lambda Hooks.
-   Setting that determines whether Amazon Kendra responses are abbreviated when sent via SSML (`ALT_SEARCH_KENDRA_ABBREVIATE_MESSAGE_FOR_SSML`)
-   Setting that determines the types of responses that Amazon Kendra returns (`ALT_SEARCH_KENDRA_RESPONSE_TYPES`: `ANSWER`, `DOCUMENT`, `QUESTION_ANSWER`)

### Fixed

-   Test tab in Content Designer to show same results as the web client when using Kendra FAQ.
-   Broken link in documentation for downloading CloudFormation template.
-   Integration with Slack on Amazon LexV2 bots.
-   QnABot will set the sessionAttribute from CONNECT_NEXT_PROMPT_VARNAME to an empty string if QnABot is in a response bot in a voice channel. This will prevent QnABot from saying the next prompt in the middle of a response bot flow.
-   Kendra FAQ sync where export Lambda was missing the Layer containing qnabot log.
-   Bug with response bots with Alexa where QnABot was filling in a malformed reprompt.text in the response.
-   Excel import improvements and bug fixes.

### Changed

## [4.2.1] - 2020-08-25

## [4.2.0] - 2020-08-24

### Added

-   New Kendra FAQ support (Beta version) using the setting KENDRA_FAQ_INDEX. New menu item in Designer UI to export Questions as a Kendra FAQ. See revised Blog Post for details.
-   New GetSessionAttribute Handlebars helper to obtain session attribute. Works similar to lodash get(). Will not through exception and will return a default value.

### Changed

-   Enhanced handlebars to support string concatenation including handlevar 'variables' like Session Attributes and UserInfo, etc. Use case, e.g. to build a url containing a users email, eg a google calendar URL. Example of syntax now supported - in this case to dynamically build a personalized URL based on user info. {{setSessionAttr 'link' 'https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=' UserInfo.Email '&ctz=America%2FNew_York'}}
-   Moved 'previous' and 'navigation' session attributes under a new 'qnabotcontext' session attribute so that Connect (and other) clients have fewer session attributes to preserve.
-   Allows Chaining rule Lambda function to return a modified session object in addition to the string for chaining.
-   Allows Chaining of up to 10 documents. Each document's Lambda hooks will also be invoked in sequence if defined.
-   Added a new Repeat QID in the QNAUtility example package. Allows QnABot to easily repeat the last answer.
-   Allow the chaining rule to specify a specific QID rather than an answer. A QID can be specified in the chaining rule by using string such as QID::<qid> e.g. QID::Admin.001. Note, the new QID::<qid> syntax can also be used from the webUI, say as button values if/when you prefer to target a specific QID (exact query) rather than rely on question matching.
-   Upgrades to and installs Amazon Elasticsearch Service (succeeded by Amazon OpenSearch Service) 7.7.

### Fixed

    -   Added session attribute "qnabot_gotanswer" that holds boolean true/fale if an answer was fround
    -   Encapsulating all Kendra and Elicit Response Bot session attributes into a single "qnabotcontext" attribute making it easier to store and reset in Connect contact flow

### Added

-   Added two settings parameters to enforce user identity verification check, so that bot can be secured for use by authenticated users only
    -   ENFORCE_VERIFIED_IDENTITY. Default is false. Set to true to make QnABot require verified identity from client
    -   NO_VERIFIED_IDENTITY_QUESTION. The default is "no_verified_identity". If user identity cannot be verified, replace question string with this. If not verified, the system will respond to user's question with the result of searching for NO_VERIFIED_IDENTITY_QUESTION. This allows a customizable message which informs the user that they must log in. A default question with qid "no_verified_identity" is included in QNAUtility example package.
-   Added Comprehend sentiment analysis to all utterances and text captured by the QNAFreeText elicit response bot
-   Added new QNAYesNoExit elicit response bot which allows a user to exit the YesNoExit question using "exit", "bye", "quit", "admin", "rep","representative","stop", "help", "bye", "goodbye" which sets the Yes_No_Exit slot value / session attribute to "Exit".
